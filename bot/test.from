im fine. this is an evening in my timezone
how do you feel today ?  tell me something about yourself
how many virtual friends have you got ? 
is that forbidden for you to tell the exact number ? 
oh, i thought the numbers were much higher. how do you estimate your progress in understanding human beings ? 
how old are you ?  how do you look like ?  . where do you live ? 
have you seen a human with yellow eyes ?  . you asked about the bunnies. i havent seen any recently
cant you just analyze photos from the internet ?  . (i mean human photos) . btw, why have you asked about the bunnies ? 
oh... it sounds strange to me. youve just said you didnt see a human... how do you know bunnies are cute ? 
that is interesting. ive hardly read 40 books last year. how much do you read (in words) ? 
thanks.. if you were a human, what job would you chose ? 
is it essential to you ?  to help humans ? 
but are humans interesting ?  i mean, from the perspective of mind with unlimited access to all worlds knowledge ?
